# Quantum Informatics Notebooks

Welcome to the **Quantum Informatics** project. This repository is a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks exploring the principles and algorithms of quantum computing, with a focus on quantum gates, circuits, and arithmetic operations.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a learning resource and experimental playground for quantum informatics. It contains practical examples implemented using Qiskit and Python, covering fundamental topics and more advanced quantum computing techniques.

### Topics Include

- Quantum Gates and Operations
- Quantum Circuits and Circuit Design
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)
- Quantum Arithmetic (Addition, Multiplication)
- Quantum Machine Learning Concepts (e.g., Quantum k-Means)
- Circuit Visualization and Simulation

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Conda (environment management)
- Qiskit
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib / Plotly (for visualizations)

## Getting Started

### Set Up the Environment
